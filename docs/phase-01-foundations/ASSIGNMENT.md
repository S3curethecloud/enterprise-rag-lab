# Learner Assignment — RAG Foundations

## Purpose

This assignment is designed to make you research, reason, explain, and remember the architectural purpose of this phase.

Do not answer by copying the phase documentation. Use the documentation as a starting point, research the concepts, and explain them in your own words.

---

## 1. Memory Analogy

> RAG is an open-book exam. Retrieval finds the pages, context places those pages on the desk, and the LLM is the student writing the answer.

### Your task

Explain why this analogy works.

Then create a **different analogy of your own** that teaches the same concept.

---

## 2. Thesis Challenge

Defend or challenge this statement:

> **A language model knowing something and an enterprise system being permitted to use that information are different problems.**

Your response must include:

- what the statement means;
- why it matters;
- one argument supporting it;
- one possible objection;
- your final position.

---

## 3. Research Questions

Research and answer each question in your own words.

1. What problem does RAG solve that a standalone LLM does not?
2. What are Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation individually responsible for?
3. How is semantic search different from RAG?
4. Why can a fluent answer still be unsupported by evidence?
5. Why must enterprise RAG separate knowledge from permission?

For every answer:

1. define the concept;
2. explain why it exists;
3. connect it to this Secure RAG architecture.

---

## 4. Architecture Reasoning

Answer:

1. What enters this phase?
2. What transformation or decision happens here?
3. What security property must survive this phase?
4. What does this phase pass to the next phase?
5. Which component should **not** be trusted to make this phase's security decision?

Draw a small architecture diagram showing the input, control, output, and trust boundary.

---

## 5. Failure Thought Experiment

Imagine a student receives another student's confidential answer sheet during an open-book exam. The sheet is relevant and contains the correct answers. Does relevance make its use legitimate? Explain how this maps to enterprise RAG.

Your answer must explain:

- what fails;
- why it fails;
- which asset is at risk;
- which control prevents the failure;
- whether another downstream control could still reduce the damage.

---

## 6. Written Assignment

Write 700-1000 words defending the thesis: **RAG is an information architecture problem, not merely an LLM feature.**

Your paper should contain:

- introduction;
- thesis;
- technical explanation;
- security analysis;
- architecture example;
- failure scenario;
- conclusion.

Cite the sources you researched.

---

## 7. Teach-It-Back Challenge

Explain this phase to a 15-year-old **without using specialist RAG terminology**.

Maximum: 200 words.

If you cannot explain the concept simply, revisit the phase.

---

## 8. Break the Architecture

Imagine this phase is completely removed.

Answer:

1. Would the application still run?
2. What functionality would remain?
3. What security property would disappear?
4. What attack or failure becomes possible?
5. Which existing test should detect the regression?

---

## 9. Connection to the Learning Journey

What foundation does this phase provide for enterprise data, metadata, and later security controls?

Then complete:

```text
Previous phase gives me:
_____________________________

This phase guarantees:
_____________________________

Next phase depends on:
_____________________________
10. Memory Check

Without looking at the documentation, write:

the phase name;
its primary purpose;
its most important security principle;
one failure it prevents;
one analogy that helps you remember it.
Submission Checklist
